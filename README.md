Hi, this is our entry for the GUTS 2014 Hackathon, although we had somethign working, it really wasnt polished enough, or working well enough to qualify. So forgive the code quality, we'd never worked together as a team before and it wasnt as smooth as i'd have liked, but i'm still glad we got something out at the end.

If the code looks messy and unpolished, its because it is. Fatigue does terrible things to you and makes you do even worse things to your code.
